🌐 WEB SECURITY – BASIC Q&A
🔸 Q1: What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?
A: SQLi is a vulnerability where attackers inject malicious SQL queries into input fields to access or modify the database.

🔸 Q2: What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?
A: XSS allows attackers to inject JavaScript into web pages, leading to session theft, defacement, or redirection.

🔸 Q3: What is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?
A: Forces logged-in users to perform unwanted actions by exploiting their active sessions on other sites.

🔸 Q4: What is IDOR?
A: Insecure Direct Object Reference occurs when user input directly accesses internal objects (e.g., /user/123) without proper authorization checks.

🔸 Q5: What is SSRF?
A: Server-Side Request Forgery tricks the server into sending requests to internal or sensitive systems.

🔸 Q6: What is Web Cache Poisoning?
A: It manipulates cached HTTP responses to serve malicious content to users.

🔸 Q7: What are Security Headers?
A:

Content-Security-Policy – blocks XSS

X-Frame-Options – prevents clickjacking

Strict-Transport-Security – enforces HTTPS

🔗 API SECURITY – BASIC Q&A
🔸 Q8: What is API Security Testing?
A: It ensures APIs don’t expose sensitive data or functions, by testing endpoints, tokens, auth, and rate-limits.

🔸 Q9: What is BOLA / IDOR in APIs?
A: Broken Object Level Authorization allows users to access data by changing IDs in the URL or request body.

🔸 Q10: What is Mass Assignment?
A: When attackers set values for parameters (e.g., isAdmin: true) that should not be user-controlled.

🔸 Q11: What is Excessive Data Exposure?
A: When APIs return sensitive fields like passwords, internal IDs, or debug data in responses.

🔸 Q12: What is a typical API testing toolset?
A:

Burp Suite

Postman

OWASP ZAP

JWT Tool, ffuf, Hoppscotch

📱 MOBILE SECURITY – BASIC Q&A (iOS/Android)
🔸 Q13: What is Mobile VAPT?
A: Mobile VAPT is the security assessment of mobile apps for flaws in local storage, communication, code, and APIs.

🔸 Q14: What are common mobile vulnerabilities?
A:

Insecure storage (plaintext in plist, SharedPrefs)

Insecure communication (no HTTPS)

Weak authentication

Debug info in production

Hardcoded secrets

🔸 Q15: What tools are used in mobile app pentesting?
A:

MobSF (static + dynamic)

Frida, Objection (runtime testing)

Burp Suite (API interception)

Apktool, Ghidra, Hopper (reverse engineering)

🔸 Q16: What is SSL Pinning?
A: A security technique where an app only trusts a specific server certificate. Prevents MITM but must be bypassed for testing.

🔸 Q17: What is Insecure Data Storage?
A: When apps store sensitive data (like tokens or passwords) unencrypted in files, SQLite DBs, or shared prefs.
