✅ ANDROID PENTESTING – TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
🔍 1. Recon & Setup
What tools do you use for Android app pentesting?

MobSF, jadx, apktool, Burp Suite, Frida, Objection, adb, Android Studio Emulator, Drozer.

How do you decompile an APK?

Use apktool to decode resources + jadx to get readable Java code:

bash
Copy
Edit
apktool d app.apk
jadx-gui app.apk
What are the main components of an Android app?

Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers, and Manifest.

🔓 2. Insecure Data Storage
Where can Android apps store data insecurely?

SharedPreferences, SQLite DBs, Internal/External Storage, Logcat, Webview cache.

How do you test for insecure storage?

Run app → Use adb shell or Objection:

nginx
Copy
Edit
objection -g app explore
🔑 3. Authentication and Session Handling
How do you test login functionalities?

Intercept using Burp, check token reuse, session expiration, bruteforce possibilities.

What is insecure authentication in Android?

Weak password policy, no lockout, no 2FA, client-side auth check, hardcoded tokens.

How do you check for insecure session management?

Look for long-lived tokens, improper logout, and tokens in logs or storage.

📡 4. Insecure Communication
How do you intercept app traffic?

Use Burp Suite, set device proxy, install Burp cert. Handle SSL Pinning via Frida.

What is SSL pinning?

App only trusts specific certificates or public keys, blocking MITM.

How do you bypass SSL pinning?

Tools: Frida, Objection, patching Smali code, Xposed modules (e.g., JustTrustMe).

🕵️ 5. Reverse Engineering
How to find hardcoded secrets in an APK?

Decompile with jadx/apktool → search for keys, tokens, URLs.

How do you reverse engineer an Android app?

Unpack APK → analyze manifest, smali/java code → find logic, endpoints, secrets.

🧪 6. Runtime Analysis
What is Frida and how do you use it?

Dynamic instrumentation tool to hook/modify function calls in real time.

Example: Frida script to bypass root check?

js
Copy
Edit
Java.perform(() => {
  var rootCheck = Java.use("com.app.RootCheck");
  rootCheck.isDeviceRooted.implementation = () => false;
});
What is Objection?

Frida wrapper to easily bypass SSL pinning, root detection, explore storage.

🧰 7. Exploiting Components
What is exported component misuse?

Activities, services marked as exported=true can be triggered by other apps → leads to privilege escalation or DoS.

How do you test exported components?

Use Drozer or command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
adb shell am start -n com.target/.ExportedActivity
What are insecure broadcast receivers?

Receivers that can be triggered without permission → attacker can send fake broadcasts.

🧩 8. Misc / Advanced
How to detect if an app is debuggable?

android:debuggable="true" in manifest → use adb shell am start -D.

How to test WebView for vulnerabilities?

Check for addJavascriptInterface, unvalidated URLs, JavaScript injection.

What is Tapjacking and how do you test it?

Overlaying a transparent UI to hijack clicks — test using malicious app overlays.

What is Dynamic Code Loading?

Loading .dex files at runtime. If remote and unvalidated → RCE possible.

What are common OWASP MASVS flaws in Android apps?

No root detection, lack of obfuscation, weak auth, poor storage handling, improper cert pinning.
